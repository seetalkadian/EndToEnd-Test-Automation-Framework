## Framework Architecture

- Page Objects contain only page-level logic and locators
- Tests contain only assertions and flow
- Fixtures handle browser lifecycle
- Utilities store reusable browser helpers
- Test data is externalized using JSON

This ensures:
- Maintainability
- Scalability
- Easy debugging
